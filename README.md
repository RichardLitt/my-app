> A react-native app for chunking images and saving them for low-bandwidth networks

This is not currently functional. What it does is show the Camera Roll, and allows you to choose an image and display it. However, at the moment, there's no reason to chunk and save the image to the filesystem, because Iridium Go already allows you to retry uploads that are cancelled mid-stream without data loss.

## Background

I wanted to make an app that would make it easier for my friends rowing across the Atlantic as part of [Carbon Zerow](https://www.carbonzerow.org/) to be able to send novel, hi-def images back across the ocean. This app was made to help them upload data in smaller chunks over a satellite phone.

## Install

Currently not an option. Clone.

## Usage

Look at the `package.json`.

## Contribute

This is currently **NOT MAINTINED**, and is considered a non-working demo. Do not expect a high turn around time. If you're interested in jumping in, let me know.
